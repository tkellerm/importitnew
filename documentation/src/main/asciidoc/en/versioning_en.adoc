== Version-Schema
The versioning schema has changed as of Version 4.0.

It has the following structure:

 MainVersion.SubVersion.abasVersion-BuildNumber


The main version will be increased for large changes.

The sub-version will be updated for changes to the code.

The abas version is the version, for which the installation file was compiled.

The build number will be increased with each new build of the project. This also happens when the documentation is updated.

The version will also be displayed in the infosystem.
